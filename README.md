# brain-tumour
The human brain is the major controller of the humanoid system. The 
abnormal growth and division of cells in the brain lead to a brain tumor, and the 
further growth of brain tumors leads to brain cancer. In the area of human health, 
Computer Vision plays a significant role, which reduces the human judgment that 
gives accurate results. CT scans, X-Ray, and MRI scans are the common imaging 
methods among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are the most reliable and 
secure. MRI detects every minute objects. The main objective of the paper is to focus 
on the use of different techniques for the discovery of brain cancer using brain MRI. 
The pre-processing was done by using the bilateral filter (BF) for removal of the
noises that are present in an MR image. This was followed by the binary thresholding 
and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) segmentation techniques for reliable
detection of the tumor region. Training, testing, and validation datasets are used. 
Based on our machine, we will predict whether the subject has a brain tumor or not. 
The resultant outcomes will be examined through various performance examined 
metrics that include accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. It is desired that the
proposed work would exhibit a more exceptional performance over its counterparts.
Hi that this brain tumour repository will be having a brain tumour analysis where in the world the peoples are affected by three types of tumour and where they can be easily identyfy that they still having a tumour or not by using our codes.
